# Solutions to the exercises in [ThinkComplexity2](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkComplexity2)
The solutions are in Jupyter notebooks in ./src/solutions/
### Requirements
Dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/nip-classes/trying-out-github-jben-estrada/blob/populate_repo/requirements.txt). There may be difference between the libraries I am using and what the book is using (e.g. NetworkX).

Version of Python used is 3.8.5

### Notes
- The Jupyter notebooks in ./src/ may have their kernels set to `physics215` because I was running them in a virtual environment. Please change it to your prefered kernel.

### TODO (aside from finishing all exercises)
- Check if the notebooks work with older versions of Python, i.e. versions >3.8.5 (e.g. 3.6).

    "**Exercise:** A natural question about the Watts and Strogatz paper is whether the small world phenomenon is specific to their generative model or whether other similar models yield the same qualitative result (high clustering and low path lengths). To answer this question, choose a variation of the Watts and Strogatz model and repeat the experiment. There are two kinds of variation you might consider:\n",

    "- Instead of starting with a regular graph, start with another graph with high clustering. For example, you could put nodes at random locations in a 2-D space and connect each node to its nearest k neighbors.\n",

    "\n",
    "If a range of similar models yield similar behavior, we say that the results of the paper are **robust**."

    "##### *Solution:*\n",
    "Below are the reasons why I think `bfs` is not optimized:\n",
    "1. The object `queue` is not of `collections.deque` type but of the `list` type. So its `pop` method may not execute in constant time. The order of growth of this function call alone might be $O(n)$ since `pop` may have to loop through the `list` all the way to the end.\n",
    "2. The condition `c not in queue` in the list comprehension may not execute in\n",
    "constant time as well. Since `list`s are not expected to be ordered in a particular way, the most general way of searching through a `list` object is by linear search which has an worst-case order of $O(n)$.\n",
    "3. The list comprehension within the `while` construct may be redundant."
